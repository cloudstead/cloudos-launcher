# Normally, things in {{CURLIES}} will be read from the process environment when the server starts up
#
# The environment for this app is set programmatically in LaunchApi.java
# Nothing set in the environment that started this process will be used here (except ASSETS_DIR, see below)
#
# Instead, the only variables defined by LaunchApi are:
#
#  HOME  a home directory for the user. if running in a sandboxed environment (from mac app store), this
#         should be a safe sandboxed (app-writeable) directory
#
#  DB_DATA_DIR  directory where database files will be stored, typically somewhere under HOME
#
#  ASSETS_DIR  if defined in the process environment, the value is still available here. Otherwise this is empty
